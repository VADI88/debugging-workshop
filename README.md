# Workshop: Debug like a pro

This repository is the base for my workshop "Debug like a pro". 

_The debugger is a tool that lets you inspect your code line by line as it runs, and thereby discover bugs much faster. 
I find being able to use the debugger a very valuable skill – no matter what’s your programming level or your role. 
There is only little you need to know about the debugger, but practicing is the key and this is what this workshop is 
all about. I’ll show you the basic workflow and some more advanced debugger features, and you’ll have plenty of time to 
try it out on a toy code base. Whether you’ve never heard of the debugger or used it occasionally already, this 
workshop is for you!_
